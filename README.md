## Notes

- The projects are based on the assignments and certifications from the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
- While these solutions represent my personal approach and instructions from the freeCodeCamp guides, I encourage others to try solving the challenges themselves to develop their skills.

## Certifications

Below are the certifications I have earned from freeCodeCamp:

- [Foundational C# with Microsoft](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Gloomcaller/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft)
- [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Gloomcaller/responsive-web-design)
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Gloomcaller/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8)

More certifications will be added as I complete them.

Also, the code for the Foundational C# certification can be found in my [Foundational-CSharp](https://github.com/Gloomcaller/Foundational-CSharp) repository since I wanted to keep it separated.
