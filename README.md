# freeCodeCamp Projects

Welcome to my repository for projects completed as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. This repository showcases various projects that highlight the skills and concepts Iâ€™ve learned throughout the program.

## Recent Update to freeCodeCamp !

All of the most recent certificates have been moved to the "archived coursework" section.
The team at freeCodeCamp is working on making their **Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum** certification course.
I will be updating all of the sections as I work through this new and updated course since it's a combination of the first 3 courses currently.
If possible, I will try to do both the Full Stack course and the separate related certifications just so I can have them both under the same repository.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this repository is to:

- Track my progress through the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
- Serve as a portfolio of my completed projects from the curriculum.
- Provide a resource for others to explore and learn from my work.

## Projects

Each project in this repository corresponds to a certification or module from the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
The projects are organized into folders based on the following categories:

- **Responsive Web Design**: Demonstrates proficiency in HTML and CSS for building responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures**: Showcases problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking using JavaScript.
- **Front End Development Libraries**: In progress.
- **Data Visualization**: In progress.
- **Relational Databases**: In progress.
- **Backend Development and APIs**: In progress.
- **Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum**: In progress.

Each folder contains:

- **Source Code**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other files that comprise the project.
- **Additional Resources**: Images, links, instructions, and other materials.

## Technologies Used

The projects in this repository utilize a range of technologies, including but not limited to:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Backend**: In progress.
- **Data Visualization**: In progress.

## Downloading and Cloning

To view or run these projects locally just clone or download the repository and open the index.html file of the project you'd like to take a look at.
If any of the projects later on require more than this to set up, instructions will be added for them here.

## Notes

- The projects are based on the assignments and certifications from the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
- While these solutions represent my personal approach and instructions from the freeCodeCamp guides, I encourage others to try solving the challenges themselves to develop their skills.

## Certifications

Below are the certifications I have earned from freeCodeCamp:

- [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Gloomcaller/responsive-web-design)
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Gloomcaller/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8)

More certifications will be added as I complete them.

Also, the code for the Foundational C# certification can be found in my [Foundational-CSharp](https://github.com/Gloomcaller/Foundational-CSharp) repository.
Since this certification is a collaboration of freeCodeCamp and Microsoft, I wanted to keep it separated from the main freeCodeCamp curriculum.
