# freeCodeCamp Projects

Welcome to my repository for projects completed as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. This repository showcases various projects that highlight the skills and concepts I’ve learned throughout the program.

## Recent Update to freeCodeCamp !

All of the most recent certificates have been moved to the "archived coursework" section.
The team at freeCodeCamp is working on making their **Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum** certification course.
I will be updating all of the sections as I work through this new and updated course since it's a combination of the first 7 or 8 courses currently.
If possible, I will try to do both the Full Stack course and the separate related certifications just so I can have them.
Much of the progress is already done for the current Full Stack course, for example I have 949 tasks finished out of 1155 in the new course without touching the CSS in it.
FCC have stated softly that the Full Stack course should be done in "coming months" so we can expect it this year, but nothing is set in stone for now.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this repository is to:

- Track my progress through the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
- Serve as a portfolio of my completed projects.
- Provide a resource for others to explore and learn from my work.

## Projects

Each project in this repository corresponds to a certification or module from the freeCodeCamp curriculum. The projects are organized into folders based on the following categories:

- **Responsive Web Design**: Demonstrates proficiency in HTML and CSS for building responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures**: Showcases problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking using JavaScript.
- **Data Visualization**: In progress.
- **Front End Development Libraries**: In progress.
- **Relational Databases**: In progress.
- **Backend Development and APIs**: In progress.
- **Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum**: In progress.

Each folder contains:

- **Source Code**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other files that comprise the project.
- **Additional Resources**: Images, links, instructions, and other materials.

## Technologies Used

The projects in this repository utilize a range of technologies, including but not limited to:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Backend**: In progress.

## Notes

- The projects are based on the assignments and certifications from the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
- While these solutions represent my personal approach and instructions from the freeCodeCamp guides, I encourage others to try solving the challenges themselves to develop their skills.

## Certifications

Below are the certifications I have earned from freeCodeCamp:

- [Foundational C# with Microsoft](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Gloomcaller/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft)
- [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Gloomcaller/responsive-web-design)
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Gloomcaller/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8)

More certifications will be added as I complete them.

Also, the code for the Foundational C# certification can be found in my [Foundational-CSharp](https://github.com/Gloomcaller/Foundational-CSharp) repository since I wanted to keep it separated.
