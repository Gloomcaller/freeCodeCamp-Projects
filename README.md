# freeCodeCamp Projects

Welcome to my repository for projects completed as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
This repository showcases various projects that highlight the skills and concepts I’ve learned throughout various certifications.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this repository is to:

- Track my progress through the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
- Serve as a portfolio of my completed projects from the curriculum.
- Provide a resource for others to explore and learn from my work.

## Projects

Each project in this repository corresponds to a certification or module from the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
The projects are organized into folders based on the following categories:

- **Responsive Web Design**: HTML and CSS for responsive layouts
- **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures**: Problem-solving with JavaScript
- **Front End Development Libraries**: *In progress*
- **Data Visualization**: *In progress*
- **Relational Databases**: *In progress*
- **Backend Development and APIs**: *In progress*
- **Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum**: *Under construction by freeCodeCamp*

Each folder contains:

- **Source Code**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other files that comprise the project.
- **Additional Resources**: Images, links, instructions, and other materials.

## Technologies Used

The projects in this repository utilize a range of technologies, including but not limited to:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.
- **Backend**: *In progress*
- **Data Visualization**: *In progress*

## Downloading and Cloning

To view or run these projects locally just clone or download the repository and open the index.html file of the project you'd like to take a look at.
If any of the projects later on require more than this to set up, instructions will be added for them here.

## Notes

- The projects are based on the assignments and certifications from the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
- While these solutions represent my personal approach and instructions from the freeCodeCamp guides, I encourage others to try solving the challenges themselves to develop their skills.

## Certifications

Below are the certifications I have earned from freeCodeCamp:

- [Responsive Web Design](Currently, undergoing updates.)
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](Currently, undergoing updates.)

This Microsoft collaboration certification has its own dedicated repository:

- [Foundational-CSharp](https://github.com/Gloomcaller/Foundational-CSharp)  
- [Foundational C# with Microsoft](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/gloomcaller/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft)

These certifications have since been updated or replaced by the issuer with newer versions.

- [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/gloomcaller/responsive-web-design)
- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/gloomcaller/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8)

More certifications will be added as I complete them.
