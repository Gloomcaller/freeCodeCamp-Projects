        <h3 class="sub-headline">Local study reveals surprising benefits of autumn's favorite fruit</h3>
        <p class="author">By Dr. Olivia Fruitwell</p>
        <p class="text">As autumn arrives, nutritionists are highlighting an unexpected benefit of seasonal apples
            beyond their crisp flavor. A new 5-year study from the National Fruit Institute shows that people who eat at
            least three seasonal apples weekly experience 27% higher serotonin levels and 18% lower inflammation markers
            compared to those who don't.</p>
        <p class="text">What makes autumn apples special? "The cold nights and warm days of September and October cause
            apples to develop 40% more antioxidants than off-season imports," explains agricultural scientist Mark Root.
            Participants reported improved sleep quality and energy levels within just two weeks of adding locally
            harvested Honeycrisp or Fuji apples to their daily diet. Farmers markets across the county are now offering
            "happiness bundles" pairing apples with mood-boosting walnuts and cinnamon.</p>
